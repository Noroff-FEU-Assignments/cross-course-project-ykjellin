    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would advise them to adopt a cybersecurity framework and maybe a vulnerability scanner. I would also tell them that having some sort of two-factor authentication should be a must aswell as having automatic use timeout implemented.]</p>
